Collaberation with Wildan, running Wellosoft.

This side of the project is a plug-in which allows 4D scenes to run in realtime in Unity. This system has required that the "camera" object system of unity be rebuilt as a custom "viewer", Rigidbodies and colliders have needed to be remade to include the w-axis in calculations, and specific optimisations for tesseracts/hyperpheres/4d plane collisions has been created by applying well-known 4D geometry laws to the standard unity scripts for these classes.

The part of this project that I plan to take on is specific to the conversion of 3-spacial scenes (using standard unity modelling) over 1-time into 4D scenes, where "rotation through time" can be explored as an interesting physics/mathamatical/artistic model. 4D scenes created this way can then by modelled using the physics of the 4Engine, where 1-time can be "reinstated" as gravity in the w-axis. With the addition of a kinematic object in this 4D scene, an effective 2-time has been added. As far as I am aware this will be the first exploration of a second temporal dimension in any simulations, which would be an exciting step.

The creation of 4D scenes has already been demonstrated, and I have modelled all platonic 4D shapes within them.
Wildan has been able to convert any meshes within unity into 4d-prisms, effectively modelling all possible "static objects" in the conventional 3sd/1td world.
Kinematic/Dynamic 4D objects are similarly completed in defined 4sd/1td space.

The next two steps to prove that the concept of this project is sound are:

The conversion of Unity animations to 4d-"semi-prisms" - this will effectively model all "set-piece kinematic" objects in the conventional world, and should open up programming to more novel concepts in time/space conversions.
The modelling of a klein-bottle in 3sd/1td space, as far as I can find it will be a world first to have this shape modelled physically.
